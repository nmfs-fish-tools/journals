%%%                        there are 12 issues per volume, plus

%%%                        HTML markup for articles in this journal is
%%%                        irregular, making automated conversion to
%%%                        BibTeX form difficult, and requiring
%%%                        considerable manual editing.  Author names in
%%%                        Web pages and PDF files are sometimes spelled
%%%                        in reverse order with run-together initials,
%%%                        such as Jones ABC for A. B. C. Jones.
%%%                        Because some Asian cultures have final family
%%%                        names that consist of a single letter, this
%%%                        makes corrections difficult and error prone,
%%%                        and the bibliographer must offer apologies to
%%%                        those authors whose name order has been
%%%                        mangled by editorial corrections.
%%%
%%%                        Although article PDF files are individually
%%%                        paginated, starting from page 1, the
%%%                        publisher metadata regrettably supply no
%%%                        record of page counts, so many of the pages
%%%                        values in entries in this file are fixed at
%%%                        ??--??.
%%%
%%%                        Articles appear to have DOI values recorded
%%%                        in the PDF files, but only about 80 percent
%%%                        of the article metadata supply DOI data.
%%%                        Some of the DOI values fail to resolve at the
%%%                        DOI agency, but the URL values generally lead
%%%                        to article content in HTML and/or PDF form.
%%%
%%%                        Biological names are sometimes not properly
%%%                        tagged as italic, or are incorrectly
%%%                        capitalized, in HTML article titles.
%%%                        Considerable effort has been expended to add
%%%                        \bioname{...}  wrappers, and to brace proper
%%%                        names and geographical names, in BibTeX title
%%%                        values.

%%%                        BibTeX citation tags are uniformly chosen
%%%                        as name:year:abbrev, where name is the
%%%                        family name of the first author or editor,
%%%                        year is a 4-digit number, and abbrev is a
%%%                        3-letter condensation of important title
%%%                        words. Citation tags were automatically
