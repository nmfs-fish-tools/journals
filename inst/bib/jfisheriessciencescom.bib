%%%                        Data for this bibliography have been largely
%%%                        derived from the publisher Web sites, with
%%%                        additions from searches of programmatically
%%%                        generated DOI values at crossref.org.  In
%%%                        both cases, the data are incomplete,
%%%                        suffering from serious information loss from
%%%                        uppercasing of authors and titles, and from
%%%                        dropping or reordering of author names.
%%%
%%%                        In both sources, English titles are often
%%%                        reported, even when the original articles are
%%%                        in Turkish.  The bibliographer has attempted
%%%                        to combine entries that appear to refer to
%%%                        the same article, giving both the original
%%%                        Turkish, and English translations, of titles.
%%%                        Errors in this tedious manual work are
%%%                        likely.
%%%
%%%                        The difficulties are exacerbated by the
%%%                        failure of many DOis to resolve, and by
%%%                        corruption or loss of Turkish letters beyond
%%%                        the basic Latin alphabet: cedilla on letters
%%%                        S and s, dotted and undotted letters I
%%%                        and i, and breve accent on G and g.
%%%
%%%                        In Unicode, Turkish dotted i is a different
%%%                        character to a Latin dotted i, but the
%%%                        requirement in this archive is that all files
%%%                        are coded in ASCII, so that distinction
%%%                        cannot be made here.
%%%
%%%                        Text encoding in both sources suggests
%%%                        confusion (or mixing) between ISO/IEC
%%%                        8859-9:1999 (Latin 5) and Unicode UTF-8, and
%%%                        cut-and-paste from Web pages or PDF files
%%%                        into a text editor buffer may lose, or
%%%                        corrupt, characters.
%%%
%%%                        Only about 8 percent of the entries found in
%%%                        crossref.org carry volume / number / pages
%%%                        information.  Only about 15 percent of the
%%%                        publisher article entries carry DOIs, and
%%%                        only about 2 percent have pages values.
%%%
%%%                        Without correct volume / number / pages data,
%%%                        entries in this file cannot be sorted into
%%%                        publication order, and cannot be checked by
%%%                        page gap analysis for missing articles.
%%%                        Thus, this file cannot yet claim complete
%%%                        coverage of its journal.
%%%
%%%                        For those reasons, until much better data can
%%%                        be found for this journal, the major version
%%%                        of this file is set to 0.

%%%                        year is a 4-digit number, and abbrev is a
