%%%                        HTML markup for articles in this journal is
%%%                        irregular, making automated conversion to
%%%                        BibTeX form difficult, and requiring
%%%                        considerable manual editing.  Author names in
%%%                        Web pages and PDF files are sometimes spelled
%%%                        in reverse order with run-together initials,
%%%                        such as Jones ABC for A. B. C. Jones.
%%%                        Because some Asian cultures have final family
%%%                        names that consist of a single letter, this
%%%                        makes corrections difficult and error prone,
%%%                        and the bibliographer must offer apologies to
%%%                        those authors whose name order has been
%%%                        mangled by editorial corrections.
%%%
%%%                        Biological names are sometimes not properly
%%%                        tagged as italic, or are incorrectly
%%%                        capitalized, in HTML article titles.
%%%                        Considerable effort has been expended to add
%%%                        \bioname{...}  wrappers, and to brace proper
%%%                        names and geographical names, in BibTeX title
%%%                        values.
%%%
%%%                        Fewer than 80 percent of the articles in the

%%%                        the DOI values fail to resolve at the DOI
%%%                        agency.  However, the URL values generally
%%%                        lead to article content in HTML and/or PDF

%%%                        year is a 4-digit number, and abbrev is a
